                        <p class="longpara">The introduction of wheat into the global food regiment sparked one of the
                            most influential changes in the human diet known to man. After discovering the staple grain
                            more than 9000 years ago, the human race has integrated wheat into almost every type of
                            diet, regardless of culture or religion (Aziz et al, 2015). The wealth of nutrients
                            contained in wheat, like vitamins B and E cause it to be the key foundation of nourishment
                            in the lives of millions around the world (De Ancos et al, 2002). It is clear that the
                            benefits of this grain are universal; however, in the unfortunate lives of approximately 1%
                            of the world population, the benefits of grain are little to none (Lebwohl et al, 2015). In
                            fact, instead of digesting and processing wheat like the average person, the bodies of this
                            small group of people launch an attack against their intestines, leaving their abdomens
                            swollen and inflamed. This tragic and painful war against the gut is known as Celiac
                            Disease.</p>
                        <p class="longpara">Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder, meaning the immune system, which
                            usually guards our bodies against disease, recognizes normal cells and proteins as foreign
                            (Alessio, 2009). In celiac disease, the main component of wheat, called gluten, is
                            considered foreign to the body after it has been processed into a form called gliadin
                            (Lebwohl et al, 2015). The intestines are sites in our bodies which absorb incoming
                            nutrients into the blood or foreign molecules which are attacked by the immune system.
                            Usually, incoming foreign molecules are broken down at the intestines into non-foreign
                            compounds so they do not illicit an immune response (Sollid et al, 2013). However, gliadin
                            is unique in that it is resistant to the forces of the intestines that break down foreign
                            molecules. In most people, indigestible gliadin is not a problem as the gliadin particles
                            are simply excreted out of the body. However, due to a combination of genetics and a leaky
                            gut, gliadin is absorbed in the intestines of celiac patients and causes painful problems
                            (Alessio, 2009).</p>
                        <p class="longpara">The first problem contributing to the unusual absorption of gliadin in the
                            intestines of patients with celiac disease is a leaky gut. Usually, the cells lining the
                            intestines are very compact, meaning big molecules like gliadin cannot pass through.
                            However in celiac patients, due to the fact that they have a molecule in their body called
                            zonulin, their intestines are very permeable to large molecules. As soon as they pass
                            through the intestines, gliadin molecules cause a cascade of autoimmune effects (Alessio,
                            2009).</p>
                        <p class="longpara">In most people, even if gliadin molecules had somehow permeated the
                            intestinal barrier, the immune response would not be very strong. However, in celiac
                            patients, certain genes cause their bodies to be more sensitive to gliadin, creating the
                            detrimental autoimmune attack (Sollid et al, 2013). Genes are molecules that contain the
                            information for all the processes that occur in our bodies. The genes involved in celiac
                            disease, called Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes, provide the information to create HLA
                            antibodies (Alessio, 2009). In celiac patients, there are two main types of HLA antibodies
                            present, HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 (Alessio, 2009). In the intestines, specific guard cells of
                            the immune system, called antigen presenting cells, process the incoming gliadin, together
                            with the HLA antibodies. After they process the gliadin with the HLA, the antigen
                            presenting cells present the gliadin-HLA mixture to immune cells in the body known as
                            T-Cells (Alessio, 2009). As soon as T-Cells recognizes the mixture, they send a large
                            signal attracting many more immune cells. Not only does this lead to inflammation, it also
                            leads to the breakdown of the intestines, causing the painful symptoms associated with the
                            disease. </p>
                        <p class="longpara">HLA genes are present in 95% of celiac disease cases, however, it is not
                            the sole cause of the disease. Many individuals with these genes do not have celiac
                            disease, so other factors are at play (Alessio, 2009). Scientists have not discovered these
                            possible factors, but have identified possibilities of other genes causing some of the
                            prominent symptoms (Sollid et al, 2013). </p>
                        <p class="longpara">As opposed to the small population of people suffering from celiac related
                            gluten sensitivity, approximately 6% of the population claim to experience painful symptoms
                            after ingesting gluten, without having celiac disease. These people have what is known as
                            Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) (Aziz et al, 2015). Diagnosis of this sensitivity is
                            usually stated after all possible intestinal diseases have been ruled out, including
                            testing for the presence of HLA antibodies. NCGS does not have a measurable biological
                            characteristic that would prove the presence of the sensitivity, so diagnosis is usually
                            completed on the basis of self-reported symptoms experienced by patients (Lebwohl et al,
                            2015). However, patients with NCGS are generally more likely to have nutritional
                            deficiencies, a lower body mass index, and other autoimmune disorders (Lebwohl et al,
                            2015).</p>
                        <p class="longpara">Unlike celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity does not have any
                            significant biological characteristic that would prove the existence of the sensitivity,
                            causing many scientists to be skeptical about the validity of the disease (Cameron, 2016).
                            Several scientists have published studies proving that other factors besides gluten cause
                            NCGS symptoms experienced by these patients. One of the main studies against NCGS was
                            published in 2013 in Australia claiming that
                            Fermentable-Oligosaccharide-Disaccharide-Monosaccharide-And-Polyols (FODMAPs) are the cause
                            of the NCGS symptoms (Gibson et al, 2013). These molecules are small sugars found in a wide
                            variety of grain-based products. FODMAP sensitivity could easily be confused with gluten
                            sensitivity by both the average patient and doctor, since FODMAP sensitivity does not have
                            any biological characteristic indicating its presence. (Cameron, 2016). In the Australian
                            study, researchers removed both gluten and FODMAPs from participant’s diets then
                            reintroduced gluten back into their food. Only 8% of people reacted specifically to the
                            gluten, indicating most patients were sensitive to the FODMAPs in their food and not to the
                            gluten (Gibson et al, 2013).</p>
                        <p class="longpara">Several scientists as well as the general public used this study as proof
                            that non-celiac gluten sensitivity does not exist. The explanation for those who experience
                            NCGS was that they were under a “placebo effect: some people may feel better on a
                            gluten-free diet simply because they expect to” due to forces like the media (Cameron,
                            2016). However, as convincing as the study seems, the Australian study did not directly
                            prove that NCGS do not exist, rather, they just provided an explanation for the symptoms of
                            a small group of individuals. In order to extend upon this research, several scientists
                            have continued to test for the presence of gluten sensitivity, and contrary to popular
                            belief, several have found concrete evidence that NCGS sufferers are indeed suffering due
                            to the presence of gluten, not secondary components like FODMAPs. For example, a new
                            randomized double blind trial in 2016, completed in Iran, recently designed a study testing
                            the gluten sensitivity of people with NCGS to determine if the benefits of their gluten
                            free diets were due to other reasons besides gluten (Shahbazkhani et al, 2016). The results
                            had proven that 84% of participants had severe reactions that were specific to gluten
                            alone, completely contradicting the Australian study and leaving several questions
                            unanswered. For example, what is the prevalence of those with this type of gluten
                            sensitivity? Recent findings prove that it may be much greater than what is generally
                            believed by the public, as many forms of non-celiac gluten sensitivity are starting to
                            appear in the form of non-intestinal symptoms (Kresser, 2015).</p>
                        <p class="longpara">With the prevalence of non-celiac gluten sensitivity rising, the popularity
                            of gluten free diets has sky rocketed in the past 10 years (Emine, 2017). Because of the
                            negativity associated with gluten in those suffering from celiac disease and NCGS, many
                            companies and bloggers have taken advantage of the situation and began to promote gluten
                            free products to the general public. This 9-billion-dollar market produces advertisements
                            in the media that contain statements about losing weight and greater energy levels.
                            According to The Guardian, "the health halo surrounding the gluten-free category continues
                            to drive general consumer interest" even though most report not completely understanding
                            what is in their gluten-free foods (Emine, 2017). After a thorough analysis of hundreds of
                            gluten free products, it is clear that eating gluten free foods has no apparent health
                            benefits for those that are not suffering from celiac disease or NCGS.</p>
                        <p class="longpara">In fact, in most cases, gluten free products are less healthy than their
                            gluten containing counterparts. Because gluten is a key element in the texture and taste of
                            many foods, several companies add preservatives, sugars, and excess fats to their
                            gluten-free products so that the foods remain palatable to the public (Kremer, 2015). To
                            put this into perspective, a normal cookie contains around 70-100 calories, but a
                            gluten-free cookie can contain as much as 290 calories due to excess sugar and fat (Kremer,
                            2015). </p>
                        <p class="longpara">To conclude, it is clear that celiac disease and non-celiac gluten
                            sensitivity are debilitating diseases that require important lifestyle changes. Because
                            there are not any physical signals visible in NCGS, there is a general lack of support
                            among the scientific community for this disease. However, NCGS remains on the rise with
                            millions of people without celiac disease or NCGS adopting a gluten-free diet for the
                            perceived health benefits promoted by the media and food companies. The accessibility of
                            gluten free foods makes life easier for those suffering from celiac disease, but in
                            general, society does not need to worry about gluten containing products. So remember, keep
                            calm and eat some bread. </p>
