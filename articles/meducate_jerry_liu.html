                        <p class="longpara">With one in five adults suffering from a diagnosable mental disorder
                            (National Alliance on Mental Illness [NAMI], 2015), it is one of the most common problems
                            in our modern society. To make matters worse, the number has been increasing over the past
                            decade and is not showing signs of slowing down (Befrienders Worldwide, n.d.). It is
                            reported that the average high school student has similar anxiety to the average
                            psychiatric patient in the 1950s (Leahy, 2008). Scientists have long questioned the root
                            cause of these conditions and while technology continues to help society gain a better
                            understanding of different diseases, there has been little advancement towards mental
                            health. Although technological advancements in drug creation have provided treatment
                            medication for mental disorders, their current effectiveness is marginally better than a
                            placebo because there is little understanding of the conditions the drug is being used on
                            (Insel, 2011). However, recent research has been done on the genetic origins of mental
                            disorders (National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2013). In this report, I discuss some
                            potential genetic and environmental factors that influence mental illness. With the latest
                            developments in gene engineering and gene modification, we may be at the forefront of
                            revolutionary treatment.</p>
                        <p class="longpara">Numerous studies have claimed to identify some of the leading genes behind
                            mental illness. It has become well known that disorders including autism, bipolar disorder,
                            ADHD, major depressive disorder and schizophrenia tend to run in families (NIH, 2013),
                            which suggests genetic origin. Delving deeper, an international research consortium scanned
                            thousands of genetic markers in over 33, 000 patients, who each had at least one of the
                            five aforementioned illnesses, and compared them to a group of 28, 000 people with no major
                            psychiatric diagnosis (NIH, 2013). Analysis revealed variations were significantly
                            associated with all five of the disorders; specifically, in two genes that code for calcium
                            flow into neurons. One of these genes, CACNA1C, was previously linked to bipolar disorder,
                            schizophrenia and major depression. It is known to affect emotion, thinking, attention and
                            memory. Furthermore, a region on chromosome 3 had disorder-linked variation to all five
                            conditions. This study marked the first extensive comparison between people with and
                            without a mental illness, thus more research is required before the results can be claimed
                            conclusive. However, other studies have been inconclusive. For example, the Evaluation of
                            Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention Working Group (EGAPP Working Group)
                            published a hypothesis on the link between CYP450 genes and depression, hoping to assist
                            clinicians with prescribing of anti-depressants (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
                            [CDC], 2011). Despite extensive tests and clinical trials, there was a lack of strong
                            evidence and the group could not come to a conclusion on the relationship between the
                            genome and depression. These studies provide evidence on the impact genes have when
                            predicting mental illness, but also indicate that other factors such as the environment are
                            involved too. </p>
                        <p class="longpara">Environmental factors may also play an important role in the development of
                            mental illness. Interestingly, the drastic increase in anxiety does not match the change in
                            the human genome of the past half-century. Using the definition of environment as
                            everything but the inherited gene, given by Schmidt (2007), it encompasses all factors
                            beyond genetics. Breaking “environment” down, it could refer to anything from drugs to
                            injury to nutrition. To describe the potential effects of the environment, Professor Ronald
                            Kessler from Harvard Medical School stated: “Feelings of pure loss might lead to depressive
                            disorders, while feelings of pure danger might lead to anxiety disorders, and feelings of
                            loss and danger might lead to both simultaneously.” To test these theories, scientists
                            often study identical twins due to their shared DNA. In one study, by Charles Schmidt, they
                            found that when one twin became schizophrenic, the other had a less than 50% chance of
                            developing the same condition (2007). This suggests environmental factors are significant
                            factors behind mental illness, causing two humans with nearly identical genes to develop
                            differently. After determining that there is evidence for both genetic and environmental
                            factors on mental illness, the scientists aimed to study the connection between them.</p>
                        <p class="longpara">Past research has shown promising evidence that genetic and environmental
                            factors are much more intertwined than previously thought. A study in 2002 found that the
                            maltreatment of a child would mutate the MAOA gene, which is responsible for
                            neurotransmitters in the brain, thus potentially causing the child to develop an antisocial
                            personality disorder (Schmidt, 2007). While this may seem negative at first, this also
                            demonstrates the potential to change how a child will act when they grow up. For example, a
                            child who may be naturally violent could become more docile (Schmidt, 2007). The following
                            year, it was discovered that young people who undergo emotionally stressful situations are
                            at a higher risk of depression if they have the serotonin transporter gene (Schmidt, 2007).
                            Moreover, this gene was also related to heightened activity in the amygdala, which is
                            responsible for processing fear. This heightened activity could cause daily activities to
                            be perceived as more menacing (Schmidt, 2007). The research on environmental factors
                            provides new insight into treatment possibilities. Rather than relying on state-of-the-art
                            technology, changing the people and environment that a child grows up with could be more
                            than enough to improve their state of mental health.</p>
                        <p class="longpara">In conclusion, there is strong evidence on the factors influencing mental
                            illness, both genetic and environmental. They are both determinants of mental health, but
                            the effect of each one on the other has not been studied in detail. Due to the nature of
                            these disorders, they are typically defined by thoughts and emotions, which vary depending
                            on events and circumstances. This makes it more difficult to come to a conclusion compared
                            to a tumour diagnosis, which is usually a binary yes/no. As research continues in this
                            field, further analyses of the interconnected roles of genes and the environment will
                            provide the foundation for more successful treatments of mental disorders. </p>
