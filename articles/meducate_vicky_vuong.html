                        <p class="longpara">Unemployed and underemployed women are a marginalized population who not
                            only disproportionately suffer from the disparity of job insecurity and lack of income, but
                            also suffer from the intersecting disparity of gender inequity. Gender inequity influences
                            health through unfair distributions of work, unequal access to economic resources and
                            employment opportunities, amongst many other routes (Commission on the Social Determinants
                            of Health, 2008). Women are typically employed in underpaid, more insecure and informal
                            occupations. Another example of gender inequity is women’s limited participation in the
                            paid workforce due to the unequal burden of childcare and household work. Family-friendly
                            policies, which includes provisions for quality childcare facilities, flexible work hours,
                            parental leave for both men and women, as well as programmes to change gender-biased
                            attitudes towards childcare and household work are critical in ensuring equal employment
                            opportunities are available for both men and women, thus alleviating the burden of gender
                            inequity.</p>
                        <p class="longpara">Job security is a crucial social determinant of health, especially for
                            marginalized populations such as women, who are affected by the intersection of multiple
                            health inequities. Job insecurity, characterized by precarious work arrangements, such as
                            part-time or temporary work, as well as a lack of employment protection and benefits, is
                            often associated with adverse health outcomes (Mikkonen & Raphael, 2010). According to a
                            prospective cohort study conducted by Ferrie, Shipley, Stansfeld, & Marmot (2002),
                            participants who faced job insecurity had significantly higher psychological morbidity and
                            higher blood pressure compared to individuals who were securely employed. This effect was
                            especially pronounced for women. Moreover, this study also found that the percentage of
                            participants receiving prescription medication treatments for high blood pressure and
                            cholesterol was significantly higher amongst individuals who suffered from job insecurity
                            (96 women and 207 men) compared to those who those who had secure employment (12 women and
                            68 men). A longitudinal study also found that chronic job insecurity was associated with
                            high levels of psychological stress (Dekker & Schaufeli, 1995). Research has also
                            demonstrated that the disparity of job insecurity disproportionately affects women. Women
                            represent 75% of permanent part-time workers, 62% temporary part-time workers but only 40%
                            of full-time workers. In 2009, Statistics Canada reported that approximately 7 out of 10
                            women work part -time in Canada. Therefore, job insecurity, which disproportionately
                            affects women, often leads to increased morbidity, poor physical and psychological health
                            outcomes.</p>
                        <p class="longpara">Employment and income are amongst the most important social determinants of
                            health. Unemployment often leads to chronic stress and anxiety, which is associated with
                            unhealthy coping behaviours, such as smoking and alcohol consumption. Furthermore,
                            unemployment can drastically reduce self-esteem, an essential component of psychological
                            well-being. Moreover, income is essential to health and well-being, as it determines living
                            conditions, a prerequisite for health. A Canadian study shows that the death rates for
                            those living in the most deprived neighbourhoods were 28% higher than the death rates for
                            those living in the least deprived neighbourhoods (Mikkonen & Raphael, 2010). Not only are
                            mortality rates significantly higher for those with lower income, studies have also shown
                            that morbidity from chronic, non-communicable diseases, such as adult-onset diabetes and
                            heart attacks, are much more commonly diagnosed in Canadians with lower income compared to
                            those with medium to higher income. Therefore, it is vital to assist unemployed and
                            underemployed women with employment training to increase their income as unemployment and
                            low-income are strongly associated with chronic stress, unhealthy coping mechanisms,
                            significantly higher morbidity and mortality rates.</p>
                        <p class="longpara">Low income often leaves individuals in poor housing conditions and
                            unhealthy built environments, which are associated with significantly higher rates of
                            respiratory infections and chronic stress (Martin, Platt & Hunt, 1987). A systematic review
                            of scientific literature conducted by Lovasi, Hutson, Guerra, and Neckerman (2009) found
                            that populations with lower socioeconomic status tend to live in neighbourhoods with less
                            supermarkets, recreation facilities as well as higher rates of traffic and other crimes,
                            which were contributors to their significantly higher rates of obesity compared to
                            populations with higher socioeconomic status. A lack of income also prevents individuals
                            from being able to afford healthy and nutritious foods. According to Drewnowski and Specter
                            (2004), foods high in fat, added sugars and refined grains are often available at a lower
                            cost compared to highly nutritious choices such as fresh fruits or vegetables. Nutritious
                            foods are essential to good health and can be costlier compared to junk food and unhealthy,
                            highly processed foods with high saturated fats. Therefore, low income can lead to negative
                            health outcomes through inability to afford proper housing and food insecurity.</p>
                        <p class="longpara">Psychological well-being is also impacted by low income. Suicide rates have
                            been reported to be twice as high amongst lowest income neighbourhoods compared to the
                            wealthiest neighbourhoods. Furthermore, low income predisposes people to social deprivation
                            due to inability to afford and participate in cultural, recreational and educational
                            activities which are essential to building strong social networks that facilitate good
                            health and well-being (Mikkonen & Raphael, 2010). Therefore, income is a fundamental
                            prerequisite to health, as it facilitates psychological and social well-being through
                            social networks and decreased chronic stress. </p>
                        <p class="longpara">In conclusion, the burden of physical and psychological morbidity is
                            significantly increased for unemployed and underemployed women due to the interplay of
                            gender inequity, job insecurity and low income. Thus, in order to improve the health and
                            well-being for women and children, who often rely on their mothers to play the important
                            role of shaping their health and education outcomes, it is crucial to critically evaluate
                            these intersecting inequities together to fully understand the health inequities for
                            unemployed and underemployed women.</p>
